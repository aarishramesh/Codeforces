 * Grisha needs to obtain some yellow, green and blue balls. 
 * 
 * It's known that to produce a yellow ball one needs two yellow crystals, green â€” one yellow and one blue, and for a blue ball, three blue crystals are enough.
	Right now there are A yellow and B blue crystals in Grisha's disposal. 
	Find out how many additional crystals he should acquire in order to produce the required number of balls.
